# cashflow

This is a simple script to generate a personal cashflow.

This script assumes several details. Read them all and make the desired changes!

It analyzes income, expenses (each one as a separate .csv) and generate two outputs: one for income summarization and its balance, and other for expenses summarization and its balance, in .xlsx format.


Incomes sources considered:
salary, bonuses, self_emp (self employed), freelance, gov_ben (government benefits),
pension, retirement, others (put one keyword)

Expenses sources considered:
Fixed (type): rent, mobility, insurance, taxes, other_fixed
Variable (type): groceries, utilities, medical care, education, maintenance, entertainament,
eating out, other_variable

## Input files:

+ income.csv

+ expenses.csv

## Output files:

+ income_bal.xlsx

+ expenses_bal.xlsx


Obs: I made this based on my personal needs and as a simple project to practice python.
